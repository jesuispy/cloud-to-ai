Notes on my AI learning journey and experiments

## Day :one: 
| Day 1 :dizzy_face: | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| **What is ML?** | ML is a subset of AI. The science of getting computer to act without explicitly being programmed. Let computers learn from Data and makes decisions |
| **What is Narrow AI?** | Narrow AI focuses on one purpose |
| **What is General AI?** | General AI aim is to focus on multiple area |
| **Types of ML?** | Supervised - data recieved already has categories, labels. **Classification, Regression**  |
|  :arrow_up_down: | Unsupervisied - data with no labels. No groups exist. Clustering, Association rule learning  |
| :arrow_up_down: | Reinforcement  - learn based on trial an error |
| :arrow_up_down: | Transfer learning  - Leval what one ML model has learnt in another |
### scribble 
- ML- predicting result based on data!  
- Classification - e.g. apple or pear  If something is one thing or the other  Binary = yes or No , Multiclass = more than two options
- Regression - example predicting stock prices, continious number a number that can go up or down.  
- Clustering - Groups of similar examples. You eventually apply the labels. 
- ASSOCIATION RULE LEARNING

## Day :two: 
| Day 2 :fearful: | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| **Framework** | 1 - Problem definition: What kind of problem are we solving . match problem to the relevant ML models |
| :arrow_double_down: | 2 - Data: What kind of Data? Structured or unstructured data. Static eg. CSV or steaming data e.g. stick prices changes over time. |
| :arrow_double_down: | 3 - Evaluation: What does success look like? What evaluation metric |
| :arrow_double_down: | 4 - Features:    |
| :arrow_double_down: | 5 - Modelling: |
| :arrow_double_down: | 6 - Experiments: |
### scribble 
- ML- isn't the solution to everything. Something a simple solution maybe better suited.  
- Evaluation metrics??
